# digits-multi-detect

first: copy this code to your ~/ , change the folder name to 'digits-multi-detect'

second: sh setup.sh

third: type http://localhost:5000/ in your browser

4: prepare your own data, like kitt dataset

5: prepare your label.txt in the data folder. Here, you only need to list your class name in the label.txt

6: use the detectnet_network_multiclass.prototxt, change the output num to your own class number. Here 5 places need to be set, line 24, 63, 2328, 2446, 2461


good luck!
